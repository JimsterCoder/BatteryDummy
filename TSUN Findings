Overview
The Inverter does not respond to all messages.
It expects a batttery which is 'on' by default. It sends no contactor commands.
It sends 0x4200 00 etc every 2 seconds and expects a response.
If it gets no response but sees battery voltage it throws an error.
We have always responded with the full 421x through 428x and this keeps the inverter happy
Displayed voltage on inverter's screen is slightly out from measured battery voltage
Inverter displays a nice 60 second countdown when in process of changing modes.
When commencing battery operations or switching modes the inverter performs brief charging and discharging. If voltage drops below limits it will cancel preparations and begin the cycle again*

421x
Battery Pile Total Voltage: Mixed. 
Battery Pile Current: No. We have only set this to 0 but the inverter will charge and discharge regardless
second level BMS Temperature: Untested
SOC: Responsive. Will charge/discharge beyond these limits. Allows discharge if SOC is above upper limit. Allows slow charge if SOC is below lower limit
SOH: No/Untested away from our actual of 60%. Display does not reflect the SOH we transmit

422x
Charge Cutoff Voltage: Responsive. Tapers charge current to observe this limit based on inverter's own internal measurement of battery voltage
Discharge Cutoff Voltage: Mixed. Dependent on our reported value not the inverter's own internal measurement
MAX Charge Current: Responsive. Stays within this limit based on its own internal measurements
MAX Charge Discurrent: Responsive. Stays within this limit based on its own internal measurements

Future experiments
* How many of the 421x-428x messages does it need?
* second level BMS Temperature
* charging current behaviour when SOC below/near low limit
* SOH: Untested 
* Which voltages need to be within which parameters for inverter to begin battery operations?

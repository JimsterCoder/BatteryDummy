These are all to be done with spoof BMS messages and no actual BMS on the Leaf Battery.
It is reccomended that we monitor the Leaf BMS via savvy CAN to ensure we don't push the battery beyond its safe cell and overall voltage limits.

1/
Adjust spoofed:
*Max Charge Current to limit power to 1kW (@390V ~2.5A)
*Max pile voltage to 390V

Run inverter on 'force charge mode'. Observe if these limits are observed
-Side project see if the sign on charge currrent makes a difference.

2/
Adjust spoofed SOC to be outside of inverter's limits (95% & 15% I believe).
See if inverter will behave appropriately.

These are all to be done with spoof BMS messages and no actual BMS on the Leaf Battery.
It is reccomended that we monitor the Leaf BMS via savvy CAN to ensure we don't push the battery beyond its safe cell and overall voltage limits.

1/
Adjust spoofed data to to limit power to 1kW (@390V ~2.5A) and tighter (very safe) voltage limits.
*ChargeCutoffVolt = 390
*DischargeCutoffVolt = 380
MaxChargeCur = 2.5
MaxDischargeCur = -1.5

Run inverter on 
A'force charge' & 
B 'Self Use'modes.
Observe if these limits are observed
-Side project see if the sign on charge currrent makes a difference.

RESULTS:
Inverter observed MaxChargeCur and ChargeCutoffVolt.
After changing settings to Self Use the inverter sent out a request for battery to sleep (8201, 55). It did this regardless of what mode I tried.
Modifying code to acknowledge this request and also switch on contactors on reeeipt of Inverter traffic did not change this behaviour.
Ideas:
DONE C Adjust spoofed voltage to actual batt voltage now it's charged up
NO NEED D operate contactors based on received 8201 mode request. Possibly prepare for 8211 requests also.

**DischargeCutoffVolt not observed. Discharged to 374V without stopping
Given this worth double checking that ChargeCutoffVolt is observed based on the inverter's own measurements of battery voltage
Tested by setting ChargeCutoffVoltto 376V.
Inverter tapered current down as its displayed voltage reached the voltage limit, even though our reported voltage was still well below the limit.
DischargeCutoffVolt tested again and again found to be dependent on our reported voltage, not the inverter's own measured voltage (discharged to 370V despite limit being 374V)

Changed BattPileVolt to 374V and discharge stopped immediately, followed by 8201 sleep request.
Changed DischargeCutoffVolt to 372V and it immediately started the 'getting ready to charge' process again.
Switched to charge battery mode (within the 'peak trough' setting) and it happily set off charging the battery, still with no wake command.

Seems as though it will not begin discharge if its measured battery voltage is below DischargeCutoffVolt
It also will not start charging if the two are very close. As part of the charge intialisation process it draws power from the battery (-192W observed) and this drops the measured its voltage.
If the measured value drops below DischargeCutoffVolt it ceases the charge prep process


2/ Adjust spoofed SOC to be outside of inverter's limits (95% & 15%).
See if inverter will behave appropriately.
A/ SOC @96%
Inverter stopped charging immediately
Inverter happy to discharge at this SOC
B/ SOC @95%
Inverter happy to charge & discharge at this SOC

C/ SOC 14%
Happpy to charge, will not discharge
D/Soc 15%
No discharge
E/SOC 16%
No discharge...but maybe because uit knows we haven't charged it.
No charge either, until we power cycled it. Then at only 220W / 0.7A
F/ SOC 35%
Still only charging at 220W.
Leave it for 1 hour
After 1 hour it had come back up to the max allowed charge amps of 2.5A :) So that's good.

3/Can we tell the inverter to shut off in emergency?
A/0x4251 Bytes 4&5, Alarms, Table 3 page 6
Sending MHV alarm didn't seem to stop discharge
Sending 3840 (all alarms) or 3841 (not defined, see below) caused discharge to stop
Note: I would expect 3840 to show as FF0F but via James' program's translation to hex it became 00 0F and Savvy CAN's translation understood this as 3840
Sending 3841 moved it (predictably enough) to 01 0F. More study by Niall required
Note: I messed up a value which caused the 'BMS' transmission program to crash and so no CAN messages were being sent by us. The TSUN stopped taking from the battery with 'BMS Lost' message and error light
Starting messages again 3840 Alarm, inverter says 'normal' but isn't doing what it should (load balancing).
Send 2058-all the high V alarms and none of the lows. Immediately it begins discharging again. Switching to charging mode (time of use) it refuses to charge.
Send 1029-all the low V alarms and none of the highs. Immediately it begins charging again. Switch to self-use (discharge) and it refuses to discharge.
Clear alarms and immediately it resumes discharging.

Realised I'd made a mistake, all alarms should be 4095. 
Sent 4095 and it stopped discharge immediately. Sent 0 and discharge began again immediately
Switch to charge, same effects.


Note: no errors in log on inverter or error light ever shown during this process



B/ 0x4251 Bytes 6&7, protection Table 4 page 6
Send 1029-all the low volt protection. No effect, continued discharging.
Send 2058-all the high V protection. No effect, continued discharging.
Send 4095-all the protections! No effect, continued discharging and happily switched to charging with the protections set.

C/ charge/discharge lockouts. Does the inverter observe them?
i/0x4281 byte0 0xAA = charge forbidden
Did not interrupt charging when set. Did not prevent inverter charging after restart. Did not prevent inverter discharging

ii/0x4281 byte1 0xAA = discharge forbidden
Did not interrupt discharging when set. Did not prevent inverter discharging after restart. Did not prevent inverter charging

iii/ With both set, no change in inverter behaviour.

4/ How many of the 421x-428x messages does it need?
i/ Cut all to estblish behaviour
Inverter display Battery symbol has cross through it, 'wait' displayed.
After  ~1minute displays fault on screen and shines fault light. Events list shows 'BMS Lost'.

ii/ Transmit only 1 message
Remaining Msg Connect?  Notes
4211          No        Program changed without inverter powercycle. Wait shown as soon as 4211 added, Fault shown very quickly (<20secs) afterwards.
                        From cold start shows 'wait' for roughly 1 minute & then fault
4221          
4231          
4241          
4251          
4261          
4271          
4281          

iii/ All messages except:
Missing Msg   Connect?  Notes
4211          No        Fault shown after cold start (Around 1min)          
4221          No        Fault shown after cold start (Around 1min)
4231          No        Fault shown after cold start (Around 1min)
4241          No        Fault shown after cold start (1:06)
4251          No        Fault shown after cold start (1:07)
4261          No        Fault shown after cold start (Around 1min)
4271          No        Fault shown after cold start (Within 1:30)
4281          No        Fault shown after cold start (not sure how long after but it never connected)
(The above tests carried out in reverse order as assumption was made that later messages would be less important)

For completeness:
Missing Msg   Connect?  Notes
None          No        @30secs goes from wait to check then 59 sec countdown Then normal operation.

=> Conclusion: All messages from 421x to 428x are needed

* 4251 Error/fault test
* second level BMS Temperature
* charging current behaviour when SOC below/near low limit
* SOH: Untested 
* Which voltages need to be within which parameters for inverter to begin battery operations?
* Basic status other values
* How long after losing CAN traffic does it shutdown?Page9, section 2.2, Charge/Discharge command. It's meant to come from the inverter but I've never seen it.
What happens if we send this ourselves?

These are all to be done with spoof BMS messages and no actual BMS on the Leaf Battery.
It is reccomended that we monitor the Leaf BMS via savvy CAN to ensure we don't push the battery beyond its safe cell and overall voltage limits.

1/
Adjust spoofed data to to limit power to 1kW (@390V ~2.5A) and tighter (very safe) voltage limits.
*ChargeCutoffVolt = 390
*DischargeCutoffVolt = 380
MaxChargeCur = 2.5
MaxDischargeCur = -1.5

Run inverter on 
A'force charge' & 
B 'Self Use'modes.
Observe if these limits are observed
-Side project see if the sign on charge currrent makes a difference.

RESULTS:
Inverter observed MaxChargeCur and ChargeCutoffVolt.
After changing settings to Self Use the inverter sent out a request for battery to sleep (8201, 55). It did this regardless of what mode I tried.
Modifying code to acknowledge this request and also switch on contactors on reeeipt of Inverter traffic did not change this behaviour.
Ideas:
C Adjust spoofed voltage to actual batt voltage now it's charged up
D operate contactors based on received 8201 mode request. Possibly prepare for 8211 requests also.


2/
Adjust spoofed SOC to be outside of inverter's limits (95% & 15% I believe).
See if inverter will behave appropriately.

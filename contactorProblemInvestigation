1   Problem
When contactors are controlled by the Pi and relay boards the inverter does not work correctly. Symptoms are:
  1/ Inverter refuses to operate battery
  2/ Possibly voltage drops @inverter when inverter tries to draw power from battery on initialisation.
When contactors are operated by direct connection to 12V battery the inverter seems to work bsolutely fine.

2 Hypothesis:
  1/ Insufficient current flow to close contactors correctly, causing contact reistance and voltage drop with current flow.
  2/ Incorrect wiring meaning pre-charge circuit is main circuit.
  3/ Incorrect program with same effect as 2
3 Testing plan:
  1/ Establish that the correct leads are being operated by the pi and that the current flow is adequate.
  Ensure 12V battery is being backed by charger so that there is no effect due to source voltage differences.
  Remove pack breaker so that there is no output voltage 
    i/ Measure current on individual contactor leads with direct connection
    ii/ Reapeat with pi control
  2/ Measure voltages on Leaf data connector for each pin
  3/ Measure voltages on GPIO control leads. Both should be high (3.3V?)

  Ensure measurement is to appropriate -ve lead. These are what part of the switching.

1   Problem
When contactors are controlled by the Pi and relay boards the inverter does not work correctly. Symptoms are:
  1/ Inverter refuses to operate battery
  2/ Possibly voltage drops @inverter when inverter tries to draw power from battery on initialisation.
When contactors are operated by direct connection to 12V battery the inverter seems to work bsolutely fine.

2 Hypothesis:
  1/ Insufficient current flow to close contactors correctly, causing contact reistance and voltage drop with current flow.
  2/ Incorrect wiring meaning pre-charge circuit is main circuit.
  3/ Incorrect program with same effect as 2
3 Testing plan:
  1/ Establish that the correct leads are being operated by the pi and that the current flow is adequate.
  Ensure 12V battery is being backed by charger so that there is no effect due to source voltage differences.
  Remove pack breaker so that there is no output voltage 
    i/ Measure current on individual contactor leads with direct connection
    ii/ Reapeat with pi control
  2/ Measure voltages on Leaf data connector for each pin
  3/ Measure voltages on GPIO control leads. Both should be high (3.3V?)

  All control leads swapped between relays. Relay behaviour the same, independent of control wiring*
  And then went weird. Relay 1 comes on without control line connected. LED2 (powered by GPIO26) is on dimly.
  
5 Conclusion:
  (Up until *: Relay board defective. Replace.)
  After *: More investigation needed.
  
6 Further work
  Up until *:We have had this before with Southern Research. Are these boards flawed or are we doing something bad to them?
  Possibly transients when switching on the coil of the contactor while simultaneously switching off the coil of the relay?
  The switching side electronics should be seperate from the power side. Worth investigating?
  After *:

Pololu Relay Investigation
https://www.pololu.com/product/2482:
"The control signal is fed directly to a BSS138 N-channel MOSFET, which in turn actuates the relay coil when the
control voltage exceeds approximately 2.5 V, up to a maximum of 20 V (see BSS138 datasheet (92k pdf) for details)."
https://www.pololu.com/file/0J620/BSS138-7-F.pdf:
Gate threshold: 1.2V Typ, 1.5V max
So it could be that the pi isn't giving enough V to the mosfet?

In beginning investigation I found that the leads to the relay control power pins were in a very bad state so I repaired & improved the joint.
Using banch power supply I tested engage and release of each relay

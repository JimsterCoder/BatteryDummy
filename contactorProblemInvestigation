Problem
When contactors are controlled by the Pi and relay boards the inverter does not work correctly. Symptoms are:
  1/ Inverter refuses to operate battery
  2/ Possibly voltage drops @inverter when inverter tries to draw power from battery on initialisation.
When contactors are operated by direct connection to 12V battery the inverter seems to work bsolutely fine.

Hypothesis:
  1/ Insufficient current flow to close contactors correctly, causing contact reistance and voltage drop with current flow.
  2/ Incorrect wiring meaning pre-charge circuit is main circuit.
  3/ Incorrect program with same effect as 2
Testing plan:
1/ Measure current on individual contactor leads
